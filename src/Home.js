      <h2>Website Project</h2>
      <p> Our first project is to create our own website and digital-card. We had to create the website using all the CSS we had learned. Also, we had to add  a link to our Github account, a  link to our Github page, and a link to the personal digital card in our navigation bar. Links are placed under each member's information box.</p>
